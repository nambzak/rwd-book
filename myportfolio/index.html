    <section id="About">
      <p>
        Back in 2022, I started my new role as an ICT Support personnel<br />
        at Nakasero Hospital. Within this instution, there is alot of IT ranging
        from<br />
        Laboratory Machines, Hospital Management System which is Kranium,
        Dynamics which<br />
        is the Hospital Enterprise Resource Planning and customer relationship
        management<br />
        intelligent business application, Resouceline which is the HR Management
        system, <br />
        MedSynapse used by Radiology. These are some of the systems that i
        support here at Nakasero<br />
        with my colleages. All the above systems are hosted On Premise and
        antoher task is to troubleshoot<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This leads to one thing and that is I am a passionate IT personnel with
        alot of experience<br />
        in dealing with issues. I have a new hobby now which is web development,
        a field i have just<br />
        started falling in love with as of this writing and that&rsquo;s why I
        am even making this protfolio<br />
        website.
