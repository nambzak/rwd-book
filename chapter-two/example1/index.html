			In beginning, Tim created the Hypertext Markup Language.
			The internet was without form and void, and text was upon the
			face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the
			face of the keyboard. And Tim said, Let there be links; and
			there were links. And Tim saw that the links were god; and
			Tim separated the links from the text. Tim called the links
			Anchors and the text He called Other Stuff. 
			And the whole thing thing together was the first Web Page.
